# SARF - The easy way to capture and trace your cybersecurity audit actions.

> This is currently an ALFA. It is a project that I imagined long ago and now I have begun to build.

## Index

- [Project Docs](https://sarf.whathehack.com/)
- [Installation](https://sarf.whathehack.com/cli/quickstart.html#installation)

## Code contributions

Creation of new listeners to integrate sarf with your favorite tool is extremely
welcome. See [Listeners development](http://sarf.whathehack.com/listeners/development.html)

The packages in which sarf rely also accept contributions:

- datalift
- simple_crud

Regarding the core as SARF is still in a very early stage the core does not accept
contributions. I don't want anyone to spend time in parts that are very likely to
be changed. You can still create issues and suggest changes that I will happily
review.

## Sponsor this project

After several years designing the best architecture for the project as a
hobby, I have simplified many parts and for the first time it has become
feasible for a small team. This is going to be done and I would like it to be
an open source project.

A series of economic resources are necessary for building this so im currently
searching for sponsors.

Your company can benefit from the development of this tool and from the
advertisment of being a sponsor in the home page of the project.

If you just want to support the project without any kind of advertisement
for your company you can [Buy me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/elchicodepython)
to make the project grow and keep me motivated.

If you want some kind of retrieval get in touch through
